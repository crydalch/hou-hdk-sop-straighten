= Straighten =

""" Straighten specified set of eges """

If you specify edge selection that contains not connected sets of edges, it will split it on edge islands and apply straighten to each, separately. 
It will ignore each edge island that have more than 2 endpoints or is closed.

Examples:

- example of selection with two endpoints
